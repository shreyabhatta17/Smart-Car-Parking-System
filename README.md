# Smart-Car-Parking-System
The Car Parking System uses an ESP8266 with ultrasonic and PIR sensors to detect car presence and movement in a parking slot. Data is sent to an MQTT broker so users can monitor slot availability in real time through an app or dashboard. A relay-controlled light can also be remotely switched via MQTT, making parking smarter and efficient.
